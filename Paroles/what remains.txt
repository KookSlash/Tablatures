 




Couplet part 1

Lost in time, burned inside
Old regrets, hollow chest
Memories crawl beneath my skin
Can’t go back again

Couplet part 2

Eyes like storms, fade to gray
Words like chains, slip away
Silence screams the things we’ve been
I still stand within

Pre refrain 

Hold on, I came alone,
Whispers in the dark,
No one stays the same,
Still I call your name. 

Refrain

We are the fading flame,
Familiar faces, lost but same,
Nothing stays the same,
But I still burn.

Time won’t give it back,
Scars remind of what we lack,
Ashes fade to black,
The mirror shows a different man.


Couplet 2 – Part 1

Close my eyes,  see it clear,
Every laugh, every tear.
All the days we thought would last,
Still they shine like glass.

Couplet 2 – Part 2

Time moves on, leaves its mark,
But I still feel, the spark inside.
Every moment joy or pain,
Taught me how to stay.


Every smile we shared
All the dreams we chased 
Nothing disapear
Proof of where we stand.
